            <p>We are trying to start a cryptocurrency exchange for Western customers as the current available Chinese exchanges are often involved in shady dealings such as price manipulation, pumping and dumping coins, shilling, spoofing and various otherwise illegal practices. These practices have greatly undermined users' experiences in trading as if the exchange is involved in malpractices, it's very hard for individual investors to defend themselves against such dealings.</p>

              <p>We want to establish an exchange that's trustworthy, fair, safe, reliable for the millennials who believe in new technology. We want the exchange to be a platform where people can trade freely with complete transparency and reliable infrastructure. We want to be the friend of millennial crypto-traders and investors, instead of someone taking advantage of them.</p>

          <p>I took these points to drive the direction of the brand,<br>and also combined them with a few common rules on branding…</p>

        <section class="fadein">
          <div class="rule">
            <p class="tiny-heading">Rule – One</p>
            <h2>Every great brand should  be simple, and work well in only one colour.</h2>
            <p>Great brands are instantly recognizeable. You should aim to create a brand that anyone can draw. It should work across all mediums – not just digital and print.</p>

            <p class="tiny-heading">Rule – Two</p>
            <h2>Every great brand should be scalable in size.</h2>
            <p>Your brand should work well in all sizes – from a small print on a business card – to a billboard on the side of a skyscraper.</p>

        <section class="fadein">
          <div class="rule">
            <p class="tiny-heading">Rule – Three</p>
            <h2>New brands should provide a foundation for development.</h2>
            <p>When creating a new brand for a new business, it is important to create a solid foundation. The brand should create a clear and concise launchpad for the brand to grow from, but should also be flexible enough to grow, adapt and develop as the business navigates its trajectory.</p>
